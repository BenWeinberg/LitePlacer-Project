# LitePlacer-Project
 My Lightplacer build of January 2021

Build notes in no particular order:

The cable, 24 AWG shielded was selected for its size and flexibility.  They use about 1/4 the capacity of the cable chain, and are easy to work with.
The X and Y limit switches use one cable each, saving 2 cables in the chain.  The cable easily handles the current draw from the motors without getting warm.

The TinyG enclosure was found on a 3D print website and mounts easily to the frame of the Lightplacer.  This keeps the cables short and manageable.

I fabricated a pc board to hold 2 mosfets and 2 diodes for driving the vacuum and solenoid valve.  The mosfets I used were massively overspeced but I use them in other products and had them is stock.  There are many others in an SO8 package that would work fine.
This board is shared on OshPark.

A second board was fabricated to add a switch for the Z limit switches to reverse them when switching between Liteplacer and OpenPNP.  Also shared on OshPark.

A 3rd board makes a clean interface in the TinyG controller for the led power leads.  Also shared on OshPark.

The table was selected based on another builders choice that looked like it would work well.  It turned out to be a good choice, being very rigid but light-weight, and definitely low-priced.  Care must be taken to not over-tighten the wood screws that hold down the LP frame.  The 4 corners where the legs attach are reinforced internally with solid wood, but the rest of the table is just cardboard inside.  I have included 2 photos of the hole removed by a hole saw to provide for the up-camera view.
